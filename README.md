# Phisas (Public Health Information System Africa)
 
## The Application is intended to:

1. Record Covid19 inoculations in Africa. Later to improve child immunization and public health disease and pandemics control.
2. For Covid19, in operation, the application will be used to collect and retrieve standardized information on the status of Covid19 immunization in localities.
3. Health Administrators would be in control of the application in their durisdictions and approve Health Worker registrations.
4. Users may interact with the application by downloading the APP from APP stores and by quering information on GSM strings without internet connection or utilising any network traffic data.
5. The Application may be customised for further use main health durisdictions agreed upon by public health Administrators.

## A typical inoculation operation would involve the following key steps.

1. First health worker would enrol patients into the Application by signing them up using either:
- Identification number or;
- Any form of acceptable identification by the health durisdiction.
- Register their mobile phone number and verify the number (where possible) by sending a random verification number.
- Place where the patient lives.

1. Expected APP functions: 
 - The Second health worker's device scanning the vaccine would include location data (health center location)
 - Health workers administering the vaccine would have access to a normal personal device (maintsined for this purpose by the health center, data/ network traffic).

2. Assumptions: All vaccines delivered would have a form of vile identification or batch/ box identification with either a barcode/ QR-code or some sort of a serial number like any other medication.

3. Patient privacy information is handled by a central public health administrator either by jurisdiction or nationally for access to statistical information.

# Post inoculation data APP functions.

## The APP may be queried and used for the following:

1. Number of vaccinations administered.
2. Status of vaccinations by locality.
3. Record of side effects reported (through a public, central reporting system); a number where users (patients and health workers) can report reactions and request to see health workers/ administrators for verification of the reported side effects.
4. Inoculants can query the APP for appointment scheduling where applicable, in general vaccinations and choose a location.
5. Inoculants can also get SMS reminders to check for any side effects and to send reminders to come for a second dosage; a date automatically set at first inoculation.
6. National statistics regarding the status of assumed herd immunity based on models proposed by public health workers.
7. To track usage, estimate the additional need, and optimize logistics based on the vaccination trends, locally, nationally and regionally. 
8. Collect other (largely optional) demographic information of the inoculants after the last dosage of the vaccine to understand the status of the uptake, and adjust public health messaging based on;
  - Locality
  - Age range
  - Socioeconomic status etc.
 9. AIIS can be adjusted to fulfill other important health information requirements and may provide a standardized reporting system which could be used to facilitate movement of people nationally and across borders.
10. The Applications adds significant credibility over paper issued vaccination certificates.
